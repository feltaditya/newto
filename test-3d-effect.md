# 3D Scroll Effect Implementation Test

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented a proper scroll-based 3D effect for the service cards. Here's what was changed:

### 1. JavaScript Changes (app/page.tsx)

Replaced the old IntersectionObserver implementation with a scroll-based approach:

- Added a `handleScroll` function that calculates 3D transforms based on scroll position
- Removed the old static animation that only triggered when cards entered the viewport
- Implemented dynamic 3D transforms that respond to scroll position and card position relative to viewport center
- Added performance optimizations with passive event listeners and `will-change` property

### 2. CSS Changes (app/globals.css)

Updated the CSS to support the new scroll-based effect:

- Removed static transforms that were applied on scroll
- Added smooth transitions for transform properties
- Removed the old `.animate-in` class that's no longer needed
- Removed nth-child specific transforms that interfered with the dynamic effect

### 3. How the New Effect Works

The new 3D scroll effect:

1. Dynamically changes 3D transforms based on scroll position
2. Responds to both scroll progress and individual card position
3. Cards closer to the center of the viewport have different transforms than those further away
4. Uses smooth transitions for a natural feel
5. Only activates when the services section is in view

### 4. Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:

1. Scroll to the services section on the homepage
2. Observe how the cards change their 3D transforms as you scroll
3. Notice how cards near the center of the viewport behave differently than those at the edges
4. Verify that the effect is smooth and performs well
5. Check that the effect works on different screen sizes

### 5. Expected Behavior

- Cards should rotate and translate in 3D space as you scroll
- The effect should feel natural and responsive
- Performance should be smooth with no jank
- The effect should work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Cards should return to their original position when scrolled out of view

### 6. Performance Considerations

- Uses passive event listeners to avoid blocking the main thread
- Uses `will-change` property to optimize browser rendering
- Only calculates transforms when the section is in view
- Efficiently queries DOM elements only when needed
